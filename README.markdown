##Skinr Export##

This module is an add-on to Drupal's skinr module which exposes skinrs settings to ctools. In order to make skins exportable.
This module required the skinr to be patch. The patch file can be located in the root of the skinr_export module.

There's currently an issue on drupal.org in order to get this module into skinr. (http://drupal.org/node/744706)
